# LightCrossGait: Lightweight Cross-Modal Gait Generation and Analysis Model

## Introduction

**LightCrossGait** is a framework focused on **lightweight** and **cross-modal** gait generation and analysis. It aims to efficiently realize gait mapping between different modalities (e.g., from high-level control signals to low-level joint angles, or from visual observations to movement commands). This model is suitable for resource-constrained robotic platforms or scenarios requiring real-time performance.

## Core Features

* **Lightweight Architecture:** Uses optimized neural network structures (such as depthwise separable convolutions, knowledge distillation) to achieve minimal model size and fast inference speed.

* **Cross-Modal Fusion:** Designed with efficient Cross-Attention mechanisms or Gated Fusion Units to process and convert multi-source input data.

* **Real-time Performance:** Demonstrates excellent frame rates on mainstream embedded devices (e.g., Jetson series, Raspberry Pi).

* **Modular Design:** Training, evaluation, and deployment processes are clearly separated, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Clone Repository

```

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/LightCrossGait.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/LightCrossGait.git)
cd LightCrossGait

```

### 2. Create Conda Environment

We recommend using Anaconda or Miniconda for environment management:

```

# Create environment

conda create -n lcg\_env python=3.9

# Activate environment

conda activate lcg\_env

# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Example contents of the `requirements.txt` file (please modify according to actual dependencies):

```

torch\>=1.12.0
torchvision\>=0.13.0
numpy
scipy
tqdm
tensorboard

```

## Data Preparation

Please place your gait dataset (e.g., containing sensor data, joint angles, control commands, etc.) in the `data/` folder at the project root.

### Dataset Structure Requirements

```

data/
├── train/
│   ├── sequence\_001.npz
│   ├── sequence\_002.npz
│   └── ...
└── val/
├── sequence\_A.npz
└── ...

```

Each `.npz` file should contain the following key-value pairs:

* `input_modal_A`: Input modality data with shape `(N, Feature_A)`.

* `target_modal_B`: Target modality data with shape `(N, Feature_B)`.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Model Training

Use the following command to start model training:

```

python train.py --config configs/lcg\_default.yaml --gpus 0,1 --batch\_size 64

```

You can adjust model hyperparameters, optimizer settings, and training epochs by modifying the YAML configuration files in the `configs/` directory.

### 2. Model Evaluation

After training, run the evaluation script to test the model's performance:

```

# The --checkpoint argument specifies the path to the model weights you want to evaluate

python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best\_model.pth --metrics FGE,AEE

```

### 3. Real-time Inference (Deployment)

The inference script will load the pre-trained model and use it for prediction on a real-time data stream.

```

python inference.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best\_model.pth --input\_path data/test/realtime\_input.npz --output\_path results/output\_gait.npz

```
